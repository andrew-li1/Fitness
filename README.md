# Java-Modified-Snake-Game
CIS 120 Final Project

A modified Java Snake Game built with Java's Swing Library that utilizes concepts such as Collections, File I/O, and Inheritance. The user is able to control the snake movement through key presses. The gameboard contains a leaderboard that records the top scores of the game through File I/O operations. Added random effect items to diverge from traditional Snake gameplay.
